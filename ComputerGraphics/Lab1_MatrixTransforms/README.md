# Lab 1: Matrix Transforms

This project implements a simple 3D engine which is able to draw unfilled triangles (meshes) in 3D space, utilizing simple GDI API for drawing lines. The drawn object is a 3D model of a glass, which is being rotated in the 3D space. Camera view can be rotated as well. To implement these transforms and perspective projection, matrix math is used (which was the key point of this lab work).
